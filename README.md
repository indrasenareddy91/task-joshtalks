- The code sorts the tasks by checking two things: first, it puts all the incomplete tasks at the top and the completed ones at the bottom. Then, among the tasks that have the same completion status, it sorts them by priorityâ€”putting tasks with high priority first, followed by medium, and then low. This way, the most important and unfinished tasks appear at the top of the list.
